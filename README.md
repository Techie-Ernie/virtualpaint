OpenCV + MediaPipe Virtual Paint App
Holding up index finger only allows you to draw
Holding up index and middle finger allows you to navigate
Holding up all 5 fingers acts as an eraser

To send frames to the virtual camera, I used pyvirtualcam: https://pypi.org/project/pyvirtualcam/
Follow the instructions for pyvirtualcam to set up the virtual camera for your OS. (e.g. On Windows, install OBS Studio)
